# SLAM-based-on-Computer-Vision-in-Autonomous-Robotics
It's a repository where I keep updated about SLAM algorithms for state estimation based on computer vision in the Field of Robotics and Autonomous Navigation.
## SLAM Algorithms for Drones and Ground Rovers based on Computer Vision:
### Monocular camera:
1. SVO+MSF
2. MSCKF
3. ROVIO
4. OKVIS
5. VINS-Mono
6. SVO+GTSAM
7. ORB SLAM
8. Tiny SLAM
9. Xivo 
10. SLAM Toolbox
11. LAMA

### Stereo camera:
1. RTAB MAP
2. KIMERA
3. TEASER ++
3. ORB SLAM
4. ORB SLAM 2
5. Google Cartographer
6. ROVIO

### LIDAR based SLAM:
1. Gmapping (FAST SLAM)
2. Hector SLAM
3. Google Cartographer

### Mapping Framework:
1. Octomapping (3D)
2. VoxBlox (3D)

## Tracking Algorithms for SLAM in OpenCV:
### Pre-Tracker
1. Harris Corner Detection
2. Shi-Tomasi Corner Detector & Good Features to Track
3. SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
4. SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)
5. FAST Algorithm for Corner Detection
6. BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features)
7. ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)

### Post-Tracker
1. Feature Matching (Brute-Force matcher and FLANN based matcher)
2. Feature Matching + Homography to find Objects
